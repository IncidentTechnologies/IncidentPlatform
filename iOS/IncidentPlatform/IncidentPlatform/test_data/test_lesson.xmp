        <text>Welcome to the gTar tutorial, we're going to take a look at the high E string</text>
        <ledout>
          <guitarposition string="hiE" fret="0"/>
        </ledout>

          When the entire string lights up, that means you should play the open string. This 
          means you don't put any fingers down on the fretboard and pluck the string a few inches
          above the bridge. Try doing it a couple of times now!

            <guitarposition string="hiE" fret="0"/>

          <input block="true">
            <note value="E5"/>

      <chapter title="Playing Some Notes">
        <text>Now that you know how to play the open string, lets try to learn a couple of notes on the high E string</text>
        <ledout>
          <guitarposition string="hiE" fret="1"/>
        </ledout>
        <text>This note is called F, and it's located on the first fret of the high E string.  Try playing it a couple of times</text>
          <loop condition="2">
            <ledout>
              <guitarposition string="hiE" fret="1"/>
            </ledout> 
            <input block="true">
              <note value="F5"/>
            </input>
          </loop>
          
        <text>This next note is called F, and it's located on the third fret of the high E string.  Try playing it a couple of times</text>
          <loop condition="2">
            <ledout>
              <guitarposition string="hiE" fret="3"/>
            </ledout> 
            <input block="true">
              <note value="G5"/>
            </input>
          </loop>
